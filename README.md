# usmelt

usmelt is a python package to control hardware devices necessary to run a sheet jet sample delivery experiment, like the one described in [https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252523007972](https://doi.org/10.1107/S2052252523007972)

### Duplicate COM ports under Windows

Windows sometimes assigns two different devices to the same COM port (e.g. [1](https://superuser.com/questions/1587613/windows-10-two-serial-usb-devices-were-given-an-identical-port-number), [2](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/com-port-changes-and-same-for-two-devices-after/84837db6-2ef3-4fa6-9568-47e8805bd290)). This makes communication with the devices impossible using the COM port.
The workaround is to manually change the COM port assigned.
1. Open Device manager and right click on start button
and then on Device manager.
2. Expand port "COMS & LPT".
3. Right click on problematic device and then on properties.
4. Go to port settings and click on Advanced.
5. You will be able to make the changes on this screen.
